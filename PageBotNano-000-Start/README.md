# PageBotNano-000-Start	
PageBotNano is a top-down evolving, lightweight training version of PageBot. It isn't compatible with PageBot, but it shares PageBot's structure. 

## In this version

This version of PageBotNano doesnâ€™t use any classes. It contains a set of starter exercises with standard Python patterns, in combination with the process of extracting parameters from existing graphic design and typography.

This first PageBotNano-000-Start is just using the standard DrawBot functions as documented on the https://www.drawbot.com site.

For compatibility, the hierarchy and naming in the exercises in kept identical to the DrawBot website.

# DrawBot
 
## Shapes

### Primitives

~~~
# draw a rectangle
#    x    y    w    h
rect(100, 100, 400, 400)
~~~


## DesignDesign.Space exercises

DesignDesign.Space exercises in additions to the DrawBot website examples.
These prepare for the PageBotNano version sequence, starting from scratch for people without Pything/coding experience.

For a full list of exercises with design process see [DesignDesign.Space/Scales](https://designdesign.space/scales.html)

The Scales are number coded. The specific focus of Scales assignment can be derived from their number range of 100. Note, however, that most assignment will have multiple aspects combined:

* 000 Preparing and Projects
* 100 Sketching
* 200 Research
* 400 Algorithms and coding
* 500 Optics and esthetics
* 600 Process
* 700 Design edudation
* 800 Testing, selection and feedback
* 900 Target, requirements and customers
* 1000 Type and typography
* 1100 Graphic design
* 1200 Design of identities
* 1300 Publication design
* 1400 Web design
* 1500 3D Design
* 1600 Product design
* 1700 Environmental design
