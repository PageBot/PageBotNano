# PageBotNano-002-Exporting
PageBotNano is a top-down evolving light-weight training version of PageBot. It is not compatible, but shares the same structure. 

## New to this version

* Adding the size of document, that is copied as default size value for pages
* Add the **constants.py** file with standard paper sizes and other values that donâ€™t change.
* Exporting to a **_export** folder that does not commit changes to Github.
* Automatic creation of the **_export** folder if it does not exist. This folder is the export storage where files are saved that should not commit to Github.
* Fill the document page with a dark gray background and a white title for now.
* Export the document to show the result in this **README.md** file (if this .md is opened in MacDown)

## Gallery

The **gallery** folder contains example output result.
