# PageBotNano-025-SmallTools

This part of the library introduces the functionality of small tools. These are scripts of only a couple of lines, that offer a enormous help in automaticing repeating tasks in the design process.

Slightly outside the sequence of increasing Document-Page classes, the art of making small tools is an important skill for designers. It is a design process in itself, to find the relevant balance between writing one-time-only scripts with the least amount of code, and generic tools that can be used again in future projects, automatically requiring more code and an intuitive interface.

## DesignDesign.Space workshop “Coding simple scripted tools”

The sources in this chapter were developed for and during the DesignDesign.Space workshop [“Coding simple scripted tools”](https://designdesign.space/#coding-simple-scripted-tools) and [Coding tools with a user interface](https://designdesign.space/#coding-in-python2)

The first workshop is focused on very short scripts, only a couple of lines long, that automate repeating tasks in the design process. The result is a set of example scripts that can later be modified to be used in real life projects.

You can make a selection from the following exercises. And it is also possible to bring your own ideas.

## Example exercises

* Make a script that runs through folders with images and applies Photoshop-like filters on each of them;
* Make a script that draws graphs based on information from a spreadsheet. Save the pages in PDF documents, using your own layout;
* Make a script that generates a simple website, based on content in a Markdown file.
* Make a script that checks a font for mistakes in spacing and kerning;
* Make a script that generates TTF and OTF fonts, after doing some automated operations on the outlines.
