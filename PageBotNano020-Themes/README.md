# PageBotNano #020 Theme

Changes in this version:

* Adding themes
* Add ColorSpecimen.py generator for colors overview charts.
* Add element type ColorCell, to show a color with its approximated recipes, in various layouts and various labels,
* The ColorCell puts labels between parenthesis if these values are approximations of the base type of the color. E.g. of a color is defined by **rgb**, then the **color.spot** cannot be an exact match.
