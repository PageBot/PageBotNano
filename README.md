# PageBotNano
PageBotNano is a top-down evolving light-weight training version of PageBot. It is not compatible, but shares that same structure. 

The libraries (with examples) are kept in a numbered sequence, so it is possible to start in a more simple version, while teaching Python classes in general and PageBot classes in particular.
