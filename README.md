# PageBotNano
PageBotNano is a top-down evolving, lightweight training version of PageBot. It isn't compatible with PageBot, but it shares PageBot's structure. 

Various versions of the PageBotNano library (with examples) are kept in a numbered sequence, so it's possible to start with simpler versions when teaching Python classes in general and PageBotNano classes in particular, then work up to more advanced versions.

The level of comments in the code changes with the versions. Comments in earlier versions explain a lot about Python itself; later versions focus more on the characteriscs of the classes, like **Document**, **Page**, and **Element**
