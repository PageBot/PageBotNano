# PageBotNano
PageBotNano is a top-down evolving light-weight training version of PageBot. It is not compatible, but shares that same structure. 

Various versions of the library (with examples) are kept in a numbered sequence, so it is possible to start in a more simple version, while teaching Python classes in general and PageBot classes in particular.

The level of comments in the code changes with the versions. Explaining much about Python itself in the beginning, later versions are more addressing the characteriscs of the classes, such **Document**, **Page** and **Element**
